## üßë‚Äçüíª Methods Overview

### VGG-based Classifier  
*Utilizes deep convolutional neural networks to accurately identify key pathological features from lung CT scans.*

Uses a VGG-16 model pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for CT scan classification. Each axial CT slice is resized to 224√ó224 and passed through the convolutional backbone of the VGG model. Extracted features are flattened and passed through fully connected layers with batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting. The final classification layer outputs logits for binary or multiclass prediction, trained using cross-entropy loss with early stopping based on validation performance.

---

### LSTM with VGG Features  
*Combines spatial feature extraction with sequential modeling to analyze CT scans, capturing the temporal progression across image slices.*

Each slice in a CT scan is first processed by a VGG-16 feature extractor. The resulting sequence of feature vectors (one per slice) is fed into an LSTM layer that captures inter-slice temporal dependencies. The LSTM's output is aggregated using the final hidden state or an average pooling strategy. The aggregated representation is passed through a fully connected classifier. Training uses a sliding window approach to handle varying scan lengths.

---

### Attention-based LSTM with VGG Features  
*Enhances standard LSTM models by incorporating attention mechanisms, focusing explicitly on diagnostically relevant CT slices.*

Similar to the LSTM with VGG architecture, this model first extracts VGG-based features from each slice and processes them with an LSTM layer. An attention layer then learns to weigh each time step's output, highlighting more informative slices. The weighted sum is passed to a dense classifier. This helps the model focus on subtle pathology-related frames while reducing noise from irrelevant slices.

---

### Masked Autoencoder (MAE)  
*Leverages unsupervised representation learning by reconstructing obscured image regions, suitable for datasets with incomplete or noisy medical images.*

Uses a Vision Transformer-based MAE pretrained on large datasets, where 75% of input patches are randomly masked. The encoder (ViT) processes the visible patches, and the decoder reconstructs the full image. For classification, only the encoder is retained. Each CT slice is encoded, and the resulting features are aggregated across slices using average pooling or an LSTM. A linear classifier is used for final predictions.

---

### CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining)  
*Uses CLIP‚Äôs vision encoder to classify CT scans without using text or zero-shot features.*

Only the vision transformer (ViT) from openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 is used. CT images are converted to 3-channel, resized to 224√ó224, and passed through the encoder. The pooled output feeds a linear classification head trained from scratch. The text encoder is not used.

---

### Vision Transformer (ViT)  
*Processes CT scans through self-attention mechanisms, capturing long-range dependencies within image patches.*

CT slices are resized and divided into fixed-size patches (e.g., 16√ó16). Each patch is linearly embedded and enriched with positional encodings. The sequence of patch embeddings is fed into a series of transformer encoder layers with multi-head self-attention. A special classification token is prepended to the sequence, and its final hidden state is used for prediction. For 3D scans, features can be averaged or processed sequentially.

## üìù Notes

**Binary Classification**
- VGG-based classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the power of deep CNNs for spatial feature extraction.
- LSTM and Attention-LSTM models demonstrated the value of modeling temporal context across CT slices.
- MAE and CLIP models offered competitive results using unsupervised and multimodal learning respectively.
- ViT models performed well, though hybrid models incorporating sequential modeling were more effective.

**Multiclass Classification**
- VGG again led performance, followed by attention-enhanced sequential models.
- Temporal modeling (via LSTM) with attention layers showed strong generalization.
- Pure ViT and 2D CNN approaches served as solid baselines but lacked the benefits of sequence modeling.
- 3D CNN-LSTM struggled significantly, indicating challenges in complex spatiotemporal modeling for this dataset.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics Explained

PulmoSense uses several standard metrics to evaluate model performance:

| Metric       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Proportion of correct predictions across all samples. May be misleading with imbalanced classes. |
| **Precision (Macro)** | Measures the proportion of relevant predictions. Macro averaging treats all classes equally. |
| **Recall (Macro)** | Indicates the proportion of actual positive instances correctly identified. Macro averaging ensures balanced class-level performance. |
| **F1 Score (Macro)** | Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Reflects overall balance between both metrics across all classes. |
| **AUC (OvR)** | Measures separability of classes via One-vs-Rest strategy, providing a discriminative performance indicator per class. |
| **Confusion Matrix** | Displays correct and incorrect predictions per class, aiding in error analysis and model behavior understanding. |

### Why Macro Averaging?

In multiclass classification ‚Äî especially with imbalanced datasets ‚Äî macro averaging ensures fair representation of all classes when computing metrics.

- **Macro averaging**: Equal weight for each class, highlighting model performance across all categories.
- **Micro averaging**: Favors dominant classes, less useful for rare disease detection.
- **Weighted averaging**: Accounts for class frequency but can mask poor performance on minority classes.

Given the clinical relevance of underrepresented conditions, macro metrics provide a fairer and more informative evaluation framework.

## üìê Metric Calculation Details

This section explains how each evaluation metric is calculated. For multi-class classification problems, we use **macro-averaging**, which treats all classes equally by computing the metric independently for each class and then averaging. This is particularly useful when the classes are imbalanced.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for Binary Classification:**  
> Although the formulas below describe **macro-averaging** (commonly used in multi-class scenarios), for **binary classification**, we report standard (non-macro) metrics. This is intentional and acceptable since macro-averaging is redundant when only two classes are involved.

---

### **Accuracy**
**Accuracy** = (Number of Correct Predictions) √∑ (Total Number of Predictions)

---

### **Precision (Macro-Averaged)**
For each class *i*:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Precision·µ¢** = TP·µ¢ √∑ (TP·µ¢ + FP·µ¢)

Then:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Macro Precision** = (1 √∑ N) √ó Œ£·µ¢ Precision·µ¢

---

### **Recall (Macro-Averaged)**
For each class *i*:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Recall·µ¢** = TP·µ¢ √∑ (TP·µ¢ + FN·µ¢)

Then:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Macro Recall** = (1 √∑ N) √ó Œ£·µ¢ Recall·µ¢

---

### **F1 Score (Macro-Averaged)**
For each class *i*:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**F1·µ¢** = (2 √ó Precision·µ¢ √ó Recall·µ¢) √∑ (Precision·µ¢ + Recall·µ¢)

Then:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ**Macro F1** = (1 √∑ N) √ó Œ£·µ¢ F1·µ¢

---

### **AUC (One-vs-Rest, Macro-Averaged)**
**Macro AUC** = (1 √∑ N) √ó Œ£·µ¢ AUC·µ¢  
Each AUC·µ¢ is calculated using a One-vs-Rest approach.

---

### **Confusion Matrix**
> Each element (i, j) indicates how many instances of class i were predicted as class j.
